# Data Visualization Recreation

This repository contains a recreated data visualization inspired by an image I observed on [Tynan DeBold's WSJ Print Graphics](https://tynandebold.com/wsj-print-graphics/). 

The purpose of this project is to showcase how visual insights can be replicated by analyzing and structuring data from an observational perspective.

## Project Overview

- **Source of Inspiration**: 
  An image from the publicly available [WSJ Print Graphics](https://tynandebold.com/wsj-print-graphics/).
  
- **Recreation Process**: 
  By carefully observing the original image, I interpreted and manually created a dataset that mirrors the visual representation. The resulting data is presented in a tabular format and saved in the provided Excel file.

- **Objective**: 
  To reverse-engineer the visual insights into structured data and to develop similar visualizations based on the recreated dataset.

## Files Included

- **`Data Visualization Analysis from Observational Insight.xlsx`**:
  Contains the recreated dataset along with the visualization insights derived from the original image.
